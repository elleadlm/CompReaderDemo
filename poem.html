        If we were a rock 'n' roll band, <br />
        We'd travel all over the land.<br />
        We'd play and we'd sing and wear spangly things.<br />
        If we were a rock 'n' roll band.<br />
        <br />
        If we were a rock 'n' roll band,<br />
        And we were up there on the stand,<br />
        The people would here us and love us and cheer us.<br />
        Hurray for that rock 'n' roll band. <br />
        <br />
        If we were a rock 'n' roll band, <br />
        Then we'd have a million fans. <br />
        We'd giggle and laugh and sign autographs, <br />
        If we were a rock 'n' roll band. <br />
        <br />
        If we were a rock 'n' roll band. <br />
        The people would all kiss our hands. <br />
        We'd be millionaires and have extra long hair, <br />
        If we were a rock 'n' roll band. <br />
        <br />
        But we ain't no rock 'n' roll band, <br />
        We're just seven kids in the sand. <br />
        With homemade guitars and pails and jars <br />
        And drums of potato chip cans. <br />
        <br />
        Just seven kids in the sand. <br />
        Talk'n and waven' our hands. <br />
        And dreamin' and thinkin' oh wouldn't it be grand, <br />
        If we were a rock 'n' roll band.<br />
