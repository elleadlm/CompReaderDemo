      <h2>Still I Rise by Maya Angelou</h2>
      <div id="timer">10:00</div>
      <p>
        You may write me down in history <br />
        With your bitter, twisted lies, <br />
        You may trod me in the very dirt <br />
        But still, like dust, I'll rise.<br />
        <br />
        Does my sassiness upset you?<br />
        Why are you beset with gloom?<br />
        ’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells<br />
        Pumping in my living room.<br />
        <br />
        Just like moons and like suns,<br />
        With the certainty of tides,<br />
        Just like hopes springing high,<br />
        Still I'll rise.<br />
        <br />
        Did you want to see me broken?<br />
        Bowed head and lowered eyes?<br />
        Shoulders falling down like teardrops,<br />
        Weakened by my soulful cries?<br />
        <br />
        Does my haughtiness offend you?<br />
        Don't you take it awful hard<br />
        ’Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines<br />
        Diggin’ in my own backyard.<br />
        <br />
        You may shoot me with your words,<br />
        You may cut me with your eyes,<br />
        You may kill me with your hatefulness,<br />
        But still, like air, I’ll rise.<br />
        <br />
        Does my sexiness upset you?<br />
        Does it come as a surprise<br />
        That I dance like I've got diamonds<br />
        At the meeting of my thighs?<br />
        <br />
        Out of the huts of history’s shame<br />
        I rise<br />
        Up from a past that’s rooted in pain<br />
        I rise<br />
