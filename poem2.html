      <h2>Sleep by Annie Matheson</h2>
      <div id="timer">10:00</div>
      <p>
        Soft silence of the summer night! <br />
        Alive with wistful murmurings, <br />
        Enfold me in thy quiet might: <br />
        Shake o’er my head thy slump’rous wings, <br />
        So cool and light: <br />
        Let me forget all earthly things <br />
        In sleep to-night! <br />
        <br />
        Tired roses, passionately sweet, <br />
        Are leaning on their cool green leaves, <br />
        The mignotte about my feet <br />
        A maze of tangled fragrance weaves, <br />
        Where dewdrops meet: <br />
        Kind sleep the weary world bereaves <br />
        Of noise and heat. <br />
        <br />
        White lilies, as falling snow, <br />
        And redolent of tenderness, <br />
        Are gently swaying to and fro, <br />
        Lulled by the breath of evening less <br />
        Than by the low <br />
        Music of sleepy winds, that bless <br />
        The buds that grow. <br />
        <br />
        The air is like a mother’s hand <br />
        Laid softly on a throbbing brow, <br />
        And o’er the darksome, dewy land <br />
        The peace of heaven is stealing now, <br />
        While, hand in hand, <br />
        Young angels tell the flowers how <br />
        Their lives are planned. <br />
        <br />
        From yon deep sky the quiet stars <br />
        Look down with steadfast eloquence, <br />
        And God the prison door unbars <br />
        That held the mute world’s in most sense <br />
        From all the wars <br />
        Of day’s loud hurry and turbulence; <br />
        And nothing now the silence mars <br />
        Of love intense. <br />
